## Journey into Natural Language Processing

This series of articles follows my first steps into natural language processing. Coming from a solid machine learning and computer vision background, I delve into basic problems in NLP. The emphasis in this series is to build intuition about the basic concepts and demonstrate the code required to implement the ideas in modern deep learning libraries. To facilitate this, the articles are presented in the popular Jupyter Notebook format.

### [JNLP 1 - Word Representations](http://haidark.github.io/files/JNLP/JNLP 1 - Word Representations)
In the first article I discuss word embeddings: what they are and how they used.

### [JNLP 2 - Word Representations](http://haidark.github.io/files/JNLP/JNLP 2 - Sentiment Classification)
The second article introduces a basic natural language problem, classifying the sentiment expressed in a short text.
