I am currently a PhD student at the Data Science Research Center (DSRC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). My work with Prof. Bulent Yener focuses on developing methods specially designed for classifying, predicting, and analyzing time series medical data. We work in collaboration with a team of doctors from the Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. 

Alongside my research with the DSRC, I have worked as a researcher with a number of tech companies. Recently, I worked with Siemens Corporate technology to develop anomaly detection systems for automated industrial processes. As an intern at IBM Research for two summers, I explored the scalability limitations of existing parallel training algorithms for deep neural networks on IBM's HPC and developed communication schemes to circumvent those limitations.
