This series of articles follows my first steps into natural language processing. Coming from a solid machine learning and computer vision background, I delve into basic problems in NLP. The emphasis in this series is to build intuition about the basic concepts and demonstrate the code required to implement the ideas in modern deep learning libraries. To facilitate this, I have chosen to present the articles in the popular Jupyter Notebook format.

In this first article I discuss word embeddings: what they are and how they used.
